## FUTURES-HERO
Leverage Trading Automation on Binance Futures.  
This is a `Set and Forget` script, means you need to keep it running 24/7 and forget about it.  
**The bot is stable in current version therefore no new changes until new bugs been spotted.**  
**I do not use this bot personally, however, I do use the other 2 bots:**  
- https://github.com/zyairelai/buy-low-sell-high
- https://github.com/zyairelai/long-term-low-leverage

<a name="hello_disclaimer"></a>
## DISCLAIMER
This automation software is implemented base on my PERSONAL MANUAL TRADING STRATEGY.  
However not all my manual trading strategies are completely transformed into code.  
For example, common sense, 6th sense, knowing when to stop trading are **NOT** the part I could do in this code.  

**LEVERAGE TRADING IS A HIGH RISK GAME.**  
**PLEASE MANAGE YOUR RISK LEVEL BEFORE USING MY SCRIPT.**

<a name="how_it_works"></a>
## HOW-IT-WORKS
In short, this code takes these few conditions into considerations:  
4-hour timeframe, 1-hour timeframe and 1-minute timeframe

1. It checks the overall main direction, 4-hour.  
   Let's say the newest current 4-hour candle is `GREEN`.  

2. Then it checks the 1-hour candle for confirmation.  
   Let's say the newest current 1-hour candle is matched with 4-hour candle `GREEN`.  

3. Since both main direction and confirmation are `GREEN`, now it will find an entry  
   (The part which I am not able to implement into code). 

4. The entry will be on the 1-minute chart.  
   In the case above, it will look for a `LONG` position entry.

## HOW-TO-USE
<a name="environment_setup"></a>
### 1. ENVIRONMENT SETUP
Paste the following into your Default Shell
```
export BINANCE_KEY="your_binance_api_key"
export BINANCE_SECRET="your_binance_secret_key"
```

Or as an ALTERNATIVE, you can change `line 7-9` in `binance_futures_api.py` to following: 
```
api_key     = "your_binance_api_key"
api_secret  = "your_binance_secret_key"
client      = Client(api_key, api_secret)
```
Don't forget the `" "` symbol to make your API key into `STRING` type!  

**I WILL NO LONGER ANSWER QUESTION REGARDING TO THIS ERROR:**
```
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'encode'
``` 
**QUICK GOOGLE SEARCH or FIX YOUR API KEY**  
**DO NOT SPAM MY EMAIL AND DISTURB MY PEACEFUL LIFE LOL**

### 3. CONFIGURATIONS
Before running, maybe you want to see how the output looks like.  
The settings can be configured in `config.py`.

| Variables           | Description                                                                                            |
| --------------------| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `live_trade`        |`True` to place actual order <br /> `False` to see sample output                                        |
| `coin`              | You can put your coin list here, to add more it will be ["BTC", "ETH"]                                 |
| `quantity`          | Trade amount. You can run `util_cal_tradeAmt.py` to check the trade amount                             |

The following code illustrate how you add more pairs to trade with:  
```
coin = ["BTC", "ETH"]
quantity = [0.001, 0.01]
```

<a name="run"></a>
### 4. RUN
You can select your strategy in the `strategies` folder.  

Just replace the `strategy.py` file with any strategy in that folder and you are good to go.  

The default strategy is `strategy_hybrid.py`.  

Now if you are all ready, set `live_trade = True` and ...

Let's make the magic happens!
```
python3 run.py
```

**Make sure you are having Python 3.8 as default python, else you might need to specify your path with python3.8**
